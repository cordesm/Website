                  <p>Stable subgroups and the Morse boundary are two systematic approaches to collect and study the hyperbolic aspects of finitely generated groups. In this paper we unify and generalize these strategies by viewing any geodesic metric space as a countable union of stable subspaces: we show that every stable subgroup is a quasi-convex subset of a set in this collection and that the Morse boundary is recovered as the direct limit of the usual Gromov boundaries of these hyperbolic subspaces.</p>

                  <p>We use this approach, together with results of Leininger--Schleimer, to deduce that there is no purely geometric obstruction to the existence of a non-virtually-free convex cocompact subgroup of a mapping class group.</p>

                  <p>In addition, we define two new quasi-isometry invariant notions of dimension: the stable dimension, which measures the maximal asymptotic dimension of a stable subset; and the Morse capacity dimension, which naturally generalises Buyalo's capacity dimension for boundaries of hyperbolic spaces.</p>

                  <p>We prove that every stable subset of a right-angled Artin group is quasi-isometric to a tree; and that the stable dimension of a mapping class group is bounded from above by a multiple of the complexity of the surface. In the case of relatively hyperbolic groups we show that finite stable dimension is inherited from peripheral subgroups.</p>

                  <p>Finally, we show that all classical small cancellation groups and certain Gromov monster groups have stable dimension at most 2.</p>

                  <p>We introduce a new type of boundary for proper geodesic spaces, called the Morse boundary, that is constructed with rays that identify the "hyperbolic directions" in that space. This boundary is a quasi-isometry invariant and thus produces a well-defined boundary for any finitely generated group. In the case of a proper CAT(0) space this boundary is the contracting boundary of Charney and Sultan, and in the case of a proper Gromov hyperbolic space this boundary is the Gromov boundary. We prove three results about the Morse boundary of Teichmüller space. First, we show that the Morse boundary of the mapping class group of a surface is homeomorphic to the Morse boundary of the Teichmüller space of that surface. Second, using a result of Leininger and Schleimer, we show that Morse boundaries of Teichmüller space can contain spheres of arbitrarily high dimension. Finally, we show that there is an injective continuous map of the Morse boundary  of Teichmüller space into the Thurston compactification of Teichmüller space by projective measured foliations. </p>

                  <p>We study random nilpotent groups in the well-established style of random groups, by choosing relators uniformly among freely reduced words of (nearly) equal length and letting the length tend to infinity. Whereas random groups are quotients of a free group by such a random set of relators, random nilpotent groups are formed as corresponding quotients of a free nilpotent group. This model reveals new phenomena because nilpotent groups are not "visible" in the standard model of random groups (due to the sharp phase transition from infinite hyperbolic to trivial groups).</p>
